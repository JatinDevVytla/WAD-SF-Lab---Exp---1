			<h1> Electrical and Electronics Engineering </h1>
			<p> Electrical and electronics engineering is a field that integrates the study and application of electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism. While electrical engineering focuses on the large-scale generation, transmission, and distribution of power, electronics engineering is a sub-discipline that concentrates on the design of low-voltage electronic circuits, devices, and systems, such as those found in computers and smartphones. The combined field covers a broad range of applications, from power systems to consumer electronics and telecommunications.    </p>
